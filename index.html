<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) can cause large changes to industry concentration and firm productivity. I develop a general equilibrium model of imperfect competition where firms can merge with other firms to analyze the impact of M&A on industry structure, firm productivity, and aggregate outcomes. Despite a rich one-to-one roommate matching process to determine who merges with whom, I am able to characterize the pattern of matching and detail cases of the model that admit analytically tractable solutions. I determine the aggregate level and dispersion of markups that can be attributed to M&A. The level of concentration, as well as aggregate patterns on who merges with whom, support the view that mergers drive higher market power and do not result in large productivity-enhancing synergies. Despite this, counterfactual analysis shows that mergers tend to increase aggregate productivity as they reduce misallocation by reducing the overall dispersion of markups, but decrease output and welfare through a higher aggregate markup. I estimate that mergers increase aggregate productivity by 1.63%, yet decrease output by 3.9%.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Multinational firms account for a large share of global trade and production and have potentially large impacts on productivity growth across countries. We develop a tractable model of international trade and multinational production (MP) to research their effects on knowledge diffusion and productivity growth across countries. We connect the theory to evidence by examining the impact of Chinese liberalization of outward investment on the productivity growth of its counterparts. Using an instrumental variable approach to estimate rates of idea diffusion from foreign firms, we provide evidence on key parameters used in knowledge diffusion models. While idea diffusion from domestic firms is approximately 40\% stronger, multinational production can have a sizable impact on productivity growth, particularly when productivity differences between multinational and domestic firms are large. Increases in bilateral trade costs can also cause significant substitution away from exporting to producing abroad. Given trade cost changes, there may be positive effects on the destination of the multinational's investments at the expense of the productivity growth of the exporting country.
